# Robotics and Intelligent Systems Integration

Autonomous navigation project for the PuzzleBot mobile robot, implementing the ROS 2 Navigation2 (Nav2) stack and SLAM Toolbox within a Gazebo simulation environment. The system supports two operation modes: autonomous navigation using a pre-built map, and online mapping via SLAM.

## Installation and Build

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/UlisesCarri/Adapting-Nav2-to-the-map.git ~/puzzlebot_ws
cd ~/puzzlebot_ws
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
```

### 3. Build the Workspace

```bash
colcon build
```

### 4. Source the Workspace

```bash
source install/setup.bash
```

> **Note:** It is recommended to add `source ~/puzzlebot_ws/install/setup.bash` to your `~/.bashrc` file to avoid sourcing the workspace manually on every new terminal session.

## Launching the Project

### Mode 1 — Autonomous Navigation with Nav2

This mode launches the Gazebo simulation with the robot in the maze environment and starts the complete Nav2 navigation stack using the pre-built map (`map_maze.yaml`). Navigation goals can be sent directly from RViz.

```bash
ros2 launch puzzlebot_navigation2 nav2.launch.xml
```

**Available arguments:**

| Argument | Default Value | Description |
|----------|--------------|-------------|
| `use_sim_time` | `true` | Use simulation time from Gazebo |
| `headless` | `false` | Run Gazebo without graphical interface |
| `map_path` | `maps/map_maze.yaml` | Path to the map file |
| `nav2_params_file` | `config/nav2_params.yaml` | Path to the Nav2 parameters file |

**Example with custom arguments:**

```bash
ros2 launch puzzlebot_navigation2 nav2.launch.xml headless:=true
```

Once the system is running, use the **"2D Goal Pose"** tool in RViz to send navigation goals to the robot.

---

### Mode 2 — Online Async Mapping with SLAM Toolbox

This mode launches the Gazebo simulation alongside SLAM Toolbox in online mapping mode. The robot can be teleoperated to explore the environment and build a map in real time.

```bash
ros2 launch puzzlebot_navigation2 slam.launch.xml
```

**Available arguments:**

| Argument | Default Value | Description |
|----------|--------------|-------------|
| `use_sim_time` | `true` | Use simulation time from Gazebo |
| `headless` | `false` | Run Gazebo without graphical interface |

**Example with custom arguments:**

```bash
ros2 launch puzzlebot_navigation2 slam.launch.xml headless:=true
```

To save the generated map, execute the following command in a separate terminal:

```bash
ros2 run nav2_map_server map_saver_cli -f ~/my_map
```

This will produce a `my_map.pgm` and `my_map.yaml` pair that can later be used in navigation mode.

## Robot Description

The **PuzzleBot Jetson Lidar Edition** is a differential-drive mobile robot with the following characteristics:

- **Drive system:** Two-wheeled differential drive with a passive caster wheel
- **Primary sensor:** 2D LiDAR for obstacle detection, navigation, and SLAM
- **Onboard computer:** NVIDIA Jetson (physical platform)
- **Simulation:** Full Gazebo model with ROS 2 topic bridge for sensor and actuator data

---

## Additional Notes

- The `gazebo_bridge.yaml` file defines the topic mappings between Gazebo and ROS 2. If new sensors are added to the URDF, this file must be updated accordingly.
- The Nav2 parameters in `nav2_params.yaml` have been tuned for the included maze environment. Adjustments may be required for different maps or robot configurations.
- Navigation mode and SLAM mode are mutually exclusive. Both launch files must not be executed simultaneously.
